BLDC Control Firmware for ESP32, UART Interface. CAN Interface is on going

Tips:
1) When motor driver serial port connect to ESP32 control board, firmware upload will fail
2) Enable Serial Monitor to set speed manually by serial port.
3) Power/CAN port need connect during firmeware upload as PCB is dual power design in orderto save power.
4) set "CRLF" in "Serial Monitor -> Line Ending", otherwise serial input/out does not work
